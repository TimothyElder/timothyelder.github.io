      <description>Installation LaTeX $LaTeX$, typically pronounced lay-tek or lah-tex, is a program for typesetting documents developed in the late 70s. It allows you to create really pretty documents and in particular, documents that include mathematical notation, figures, and tables. It can be used to typeset pretty much anything that needs typesetting.
LaTeX is a pretty big program (around 5GBs) so you will need sufficient space on your hard drive to accommodate it.</description>
