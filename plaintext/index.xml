      <description>Workshop Description and Objectives This working group is meant to give a short introductions to a set of plain text and open source tools for doing and writing up research. Many people have been exposed to these tools before, but the startup costs are non-negligible and we tend to fall back on the tools that are most ubiquitous rather than those that best suit our work. Unlike a traditional workshop at the University of Chicago, or a one time tutorial, we intend for this working group to allow interested students, post-docs and faculty to overcome the initial time investment and troubleshoot together to adopt a different and more appropriate set of tools for our research.</description>
