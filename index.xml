      <description>Timothy Elder   I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of Chicago and I study topics in the sociology of medicine, knowledge, social network analysis and death and dying. My dissertation investigates how physicians create plans of care for their patients: how they navigate conflict and build consensus, how they prognosticate and think about possible futures, and how they do all of this while honoring their obligations to ensure the well-being of their patients and colleagues is maintained.</description>
